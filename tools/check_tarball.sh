# Validate what R CMD build actually puts in the tarball.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT MUST BE RUN LOCALLY
#
# R CMD build packages the working DIRECTORY, not the git tree. Anything
# sitting in the package root that .Rbuildignore does not exclude ships --
# including untracked scratch directories. R CMD build does NOT skip
# arbitrary dot-directories; it excludes only a fixed known set (.git,
# .Rhistory, ...), so a stray `.something/` is packaged in full.
#
# Two real incidents in this codebase:
#   - a `git worktree add` left a complete second copy of the package at
#     whisper/wtest_path/, which doubled the tarball
#   - a temporary clone of an unrelated package at
#     subtitles/.godotR-boot-review/ contributed 179 of 213 tarball entries
#
# Neither was tracked by git. A CI job checks out a clean tree, so CI can
# never see either of them. **Only a local run against the real working
# tree catches this class**, which is why this is a mandatory
# pre-submission step and not merely a CI job.
#
# Portability: this is a mandatory local step, so it must run on whatever
# machine is submitting. Kept to POSIX-ish tools -- no `stat -c` (GNU-only),
# no `du -b` (GNU-only), and no parsing of `tar -tv` output, whose column
# layout differs between GNU tar and bsdtar. Sizes come from `du -sk` on
# extracted entries instead.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/check_tarball.sh [package-dir]     # default: repo root
#
# Exit status 0 if the tarball contains only expected top-level entries.

# Exactly what whisper ships today. Deliberately tight rather than the
# generic R-package set: if the package legitimately gains `vignettes` or
# `src`, that is a real change and belongs in a commit that adds the entry
# here. Anything unlisted is either that, or contamination.
#
# One per line, matched with `grep -Fqx`: fixed-string, whole-line. A
# substring or regex match here fails OPEN -- an entry named `R.*` would
# match `R` as a pattern and be waved through as expected content.
