Description: Speech-to-text transcription using a native R 'torch' implementation
    of 'OpenAI' 'Whisper' model <https://github.com/openai/whisper>. Supports
    multiple model sizes from tiny (39M parameters) to large-v3 (1.5B parameters)
    with integrated download from 'HuggingFace' <https://huggingface.co/> via the
    'hfhub' package. Provides automatic speech recognition with optional language
    detection and translation to English. Audio preprocessing, mel spectrogram
    computation, and transformer-based encoder-decoder inference are all
    implemented in R using the 'torch' package.
