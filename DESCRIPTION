Description: Speech-to-text transcription using a native R 'torch' implementation
    of 'OpenAI' 'Whisper' model <https://github.com/openai/whisper>. Supports
    multiple model sizes from tiny (39M parameters) to large-v3 (1.5B parameters)
    with automatic download from 'HuggingFace' <https://huggingface.co/>. Provides
    automatic speech recognition with optional language detection, timestamp
    generation, and translation to English. Audio preprocessing, mel spectrogram
    computation, and transformer-based encoder-decoder inference are all
    implemented in pure R using the 'torch' package.
